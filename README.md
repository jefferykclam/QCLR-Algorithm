# Quasiconformal Registration

Matlab implementations of the Quasiconformal Landmark Registration (QCLR) and Quasiconformal Hybrid Registration (QCHR).

For demonstrations, run demo_QCLR.m for landmark-based registration and run demo_QCIR.m for image- and landmark-based registration.

Remark: 
This is a simplified demo of the original implementation. The code is not optimized for illustrating the proposed algorithm.
